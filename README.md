# odin-recipes

This project will build a simple HTML website that demonstrates what I've learned on
the odin project thus far. It will look simple, with the scope limited. 

The project will also enable me to pratice my commit skills, and help me to refamilarise
myself with git.

I will review this note upon completion of the project.
